# Image-Classifier-CNN-
This project is an Image Classifier built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify whether an image contains a cat or a dog. Developed as part of a Machine Learning assignment, it applies deep learning techniques for feature extraction and classification, achieving accurate predictions through training on labeled datasets.
